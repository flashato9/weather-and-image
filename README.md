# Weather And Image

Here lies the weather-and-image app. The app prompts the user for a city, and they are given current weather conditions of the city.
The app is created using Angular 2+. The app utilises OpenWeather API to obtain weather data and Unsplash API to obtain the images depending on the weather.
